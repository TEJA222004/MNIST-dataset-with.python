Explanation:  
1. Importing Libraries:  
We import all the necessary libraries for our project,
including  tensorflow ,  mnist ,  matplotlib ,  Sequential ,  Dense ,  Flatten ,  PIL ,
and  numpy.  
2. Loading the Dataset:  
We load the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digit images and
their labels.  
3. Normalizing the Data:  
We normalize the image pixel values to be between 0 and 1.  
4. Displaying the First Image:  
We display the first image from the training dataset to see what it looks
like.  
5. Building the Model:  
We build a simple neural network model with a  Flatten  layer to convert
images to 1D arrays, a  Dense  layer with 128 neurons, and
another  Dense  layer with 10 neurons for classification.  
6. Compiling the Model:  
We compile the model with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, and accuracy metric.  
7. Training the Model:  
We train the model using the training data for 5 epochs.  
8. Evaluating the Model:
We evaluate the model's performance using the test data and print the
accuracy.
9. Preprocessing the Image:
We define a function to preprocess a new handwritten digit image by converting it to grayscale, inverting it, resizing it to 28x28 pixels, normalizing the pixel values, and reshaping it.  
10. Predicting the Digit:  
We use the model to predict the digit in the new image and print the predicted digit.


By running this complete code, you will be able to train a neural network on the
MNIST dataset, evaluate its performance, and use it to predict new handwritten
digit images.
